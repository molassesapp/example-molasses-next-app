This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) that utilizes [Molasses](https://www.molasses.app) for Powerful feature flags.

## Deploy Right Now!

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/git/external?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fmolassesapp%2Fexample-molasses-next-app&env=MOLASSES_API_KEY,NEXT_PUBLIC_MOLASSES_API_KEY&envDescription=These%20are%20the%20keys%20needed%20to%20populate%20Molasses%20feature%20flags&envLink=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.molasses.app%2Fenvironments)

## Getting Started

First, make sure you are signed up for [Molasses](https://www.molasses.app).

Next, copy the `.env.local.example` file to `.env.local` and add the environment variables from [Molasses's environments page](https://www.molasses.app/environments)

Next, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
